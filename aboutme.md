### My Story

   My name is Dakota Porter. I am a man of many talents and hobbies. As you can see above, photography is one of them. If you haven't seen any of my [blog posts](https://dakotagporter.github.io/2020-10-16-beer-me-the-numbers/) yet, data science is as well. I like to dip my hands in many pots. I find myself branching out under the desire to learn and improve myself one day at a time. My closest friends and family are my daily inspiration and motivation. Talking is a prime skill of mine; I've been practicing since I was born. As a result, I find that a light-hearted sense of humor has developed in my demeanor. However, some may disagree. That's not the point though. I'm here to share my interests and my aptitude. Although, if you need someone to talk to, my phone number is at the bottom of the page.
