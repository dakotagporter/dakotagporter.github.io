**CONCLUSIONS**

This web application was created with the intention of allowing a user who is interested in renting out a property as an AirBnB to enter their information and get back a predicted rent result for their property. A simple user-interface allows them to input only a few details and will immmediatly return results. In addition, a helpful search bar can help them navigate to other properties they have entered in the app. Take a look, click around and best of luck!
