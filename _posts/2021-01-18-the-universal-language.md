Consider a world without barriers. Conflict resolves with a pencil and paper. Hesitation and anxiety ease because the threat of miscommunication has dissapated. Herein lies the concept of _the universal language_. The idea that the infeasiblility of global understanding is only a mirage created by the ambiguity of translation. Some believe this language (known as [Esperanto](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/13/413968033/esperanto-is-not-dead-can-the-universal-language-make-a-comeback)) has dated back over 100 years. Others see [love](https://loverevolutionblog.com/kindness-the-universal-language-of-love/) or kindess as a dialect of this claim. A more common theory simply states that there is simply [no such thing](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ezpvx4/why-humans-dont-have-a-universal-language). However, I believe the solution to this debate has already been procured and has been evolving since the dawn of time. Unfortunately, it's just not as recognizable as we would think.

Whether we believe the universe to have formed 13,800,000,000 years ago or in 7 days by God, we find ourselves on this [Pale Blue Dot](https://www.planetary.org/worlds/pale-blue-dot) with a conscious seeking to determine our greater purpose. Specialists from various subject matters and diverging backgrounds parley in attempts to evaluate our reality; to discover what it is to be human. Spectacularly, we still don't have any conclusive results. After all, by it's own definition reality is only existant based off of what is both known _and_ unknown. Perhaps a culmination of this, seemingly circular, research is either inattainable or would be better left undefined. A metaphorical asymptote has developed in its place: we can get infinitely close but, in the end, never converge to a resolution. Besides, it's entirely possible that our human errors could, in fact, subtract from what we _do_ know. So...what do we know then?

Putting 100,000,000,000 neurons to good use, I can tell you that, at 9:47p.m., I stand average distance of 93,000,000 miles from the sun. I know that out of 7,500,000,000 people in the world, I am one of many who have lived through all 365 days of the year 2020. These facts specify what it is to be me but can actually characterize many others given the vague approach to the measurements I have chosen. In order to abstract myself further from the general population, I must define particular metrics that will allow for the evaluation of myself relative to the people around me. I weigh 160 pounds and stand about 5 feet 10 inches (I'm working on my BMI, I promise). I have 16 tattoos on my left arm and 77,652 miles on my car. _I_ now differ from what we know to be everyone else. I now challenge you to similarly evaluate yourself but devoid of numeric representation. Give me an idea (as specfic as possible) of who you are apart from the residual public lacking any form of quantification or mathematical terminology. Free of pure visual depiction, it's nearly impossible to construct a personal rendition of an object planted in one's reality. Any true results of this task would only produce the most vague of visualizations.

Let's refer back to the above assignment. Can one actually describe themselves without any measurement or statistical analysis? By running through various attempts, we should be able to drum up an answer fairly quickly:

**Color.** A popular distinction that can be made between one individual compared to the population would be color. This may include skin tone, difference in hair or eye colors.
Even wardrobe contents can create this diversity. [Color](https://www.livescience.com/32559-why-do-we-see-in-color.html) originates from light. The only way we are able to identify the variance of colors is by the size of the wavelength received by our eyes based on the reflection of light emitted from the object in question.

**Outline.** The next process in determing one of many is having an idea of the position they would take in our relative space. This attempt can pertain to facial features or body size. We would consider these descriptions to be shapes, which are inherently mathematic (see [geometry](https://mathsisfun.com/geometry/index.html)). Visually speaking, we only see in 2 dimensions. Thus, yet again, based on the feedback received through our eyes, we see contrast in colors which allow us to place points where we judge an object to be compared to it's surroundings, all of which eventually connect to create an outline or shape.

At this point, we recognize the exponential implausibility to progress through basic exercises without mere elementary arithmatic. Even grammatically speaking, the terminology I have been using is mathematical at it's core. Whether this was by design or not, our minds inherently understand the logical processes behind these terms and statistics. We have all learned how to read time and most know our distance from the sun. We create outlines of reality in our brains by processing information returned by sensory retrieval and provide output actions as a result. There is no deviating from this loop. Our reality is mathematical by nature, so the question now has to be asked: how does math become the universal language?

According to Marriam-Webster, [language](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/language) involves "words, their pronunciation, and the methods of combining them used and understood by a community." Linguistics, more often than not, don't see mathematics and it's processes as mere transcriptions of what language can be but rather syntactical representations for pre-defined subject matters. The opposite is true, however. Written language, in and of itself, is also a syntactical representation. For a cohesive language to exist, the specific permutations and overall scaffolding of its contents require an associated interpretation. Otherwise, the mess of spoken sounds and their written counterparts would be futile. Similarly, the application of well-known logical operators (+, -, x, รท) within mathematics can only be coined productive if we tag them with a specific interpretation as well. For millenia, we have carefully crafted symbols, terminology, and their respective pronunciations to ensure that this virgin language would bloom to become fully realized and understood by the greater community. Sure enough, it has. So as a language, given these parameters, this study, so far, fits the mold. However, the thoery of omnipresence has not yet been confirmed. Luckily,

Simply, an argument could be made that mathematics is just a field of study meant to explain our reality and, to a degree, I would have to admit that to be valid. However, through experimentation, calculation, and quantification of one natural process, additional processes continue to align with our findings.
 

Number systems were created to allow for calculation and symbolic representation of quantity. These methodologies now serve as foundations for principles ranging from the concepts of time to artificial intelligence. A little thing known as **time** uses the combination of these integers and other symbols to produce a convenient tracking system for our progress on this planet. Logic, a branch of mathematics, allowed Aristotle to shape [philosophy](https://www.biography.com/scholar/aristotle) as we know it. Isaac Newton influenced the, let's be honest, **universally** accepted truth of [gravity](https://web.stanford.edu/~buzzt/gravity.html#:~:text=Sir%20Isaac%20Newton%20was%20an,about%20the%20forces%20of%20nature.). 

The development of arithmetic since the years B.C. have similarly been an iteration of conventional, structured symbols used in combination to convey meanings and this practice was no doubt widely understood as well.

 EVIDENCE (inherent) 
 
. Our's was created based solely on the fact that we have 10 fingers on our hands. 

Deciphering abstractions of this nature is not a task stationed in everyone's skillset. This results in my claim being exceedingly undermined and gives reason to why I'm trying to garner more attention to it. It's beautiful to see the quantification and mathmatical representations of what 


The theory of timelessness has now become a time stamp.
