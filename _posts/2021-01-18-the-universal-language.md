Consider a world without barriers. Conflict resolves with pencil and paper. Hesitation and anxiety ease because the threat of miscommunication has dissapated. This sounds like a utopia; a world far beyond the scope of our own. Is it possible to generate this attractive culture absent of linguistic resistance? The concept of _the universal language_: the idea that this infeasiblility of global understanding is only a mirage created by the ambiguity of translation. Some believe a language (known as [Esperanto](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/13/413968033/esperanto-is-not-dead-can-the-universal-language-make-a-comeback)) has already solved this problem. Others rely on [love](https://loverevolutionblog.com/kindness-the-universal-language-of-love/) or kindess to be a dialect of this claim. A more common theory states that there is simply [no such thing](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ezpvx4/why-humans-dont-have-a-universal-language). However, I believe the solution to this debate has already been procured and has been evolving since the dawn of time. Unfortunately, it's just not as recognizable as we would think.

Whether we believe the universe to have formed 13,800,000,000 years ago or in 7 days by God, we find ourselves on this [Pale Blue Dot](https://www.planetary.org/worlds/pale-blue-dot) with a conscience seeking to determine our greater purpose. Specialists from various subject matters and diverging backgrounds parley in attempts to evaluate our reality; to discover what it is to be human. Spectacularly, we still haven't derived any widely accepted results. By it's own definition reality is only existant based off of what is both known _and_ unknown...so it makes sense that we can't agree on something we don't know. Perhaps a culmination of this, seemingly circular, research is either inattainable or would be better left undefined. A metaphorical asymptote has developed in its place: we can get infinitely close but, in the end, never converge to a resolution. Besides, it's entirely possible that our human errors could, in fact, subtract from our research. So...what do we know then?

To answer this, let me tell you a little bit about myself. It would be easy to derive some of this information beforehand by looking at my picture at the top of the page or parsing through the provided links at the bottom. In order to create a fully constructed mental image, however, I must define particular metrics that will allow you to evaluate me relative to the people you already know. I stand about 5 feet 11 inches and have 16 tattoos on my left arm. I have short, brown hair and my skin is a little bit darker than the background color of this article. In one form or another, I now hold a particular image in your mind that differs from the rest. I now challenge you to similarly evaluate yourself but devoid of numeric representation or measurement. As specfic as possible, outline who you are, apart from the residual public, lacking any form of quantification or mathematical terminology. Free of pure visual or quantitative depiction, it's nearly impossible to construct a personal rendition of an object planted in one's reality. Any true results of this task would only produce the most vague of visualizations.

By making some attempts to the previous assignment, it becomes clear that not many 'qualities' exist that aren't innately associated with a quantitative 
counterpart:

**Height/Weight.** Obviously metrics like height and weight or similar measurements and summations are numerically dependent.

**Color.** A popular distinction that can be made between one individual compared to the population would be color. This may include skin tone, difference in hair or eye colors.
Even wardrobe contents can create this diversity. [Color](https://www.livescience.com/32559-why-do-we-see-in-color.html) originates from light. The only way we are able to identify the variance of colors is by the size of the wavelength received by our eyes based on the reflection of light emitted from the object in question. Pure physics..pure math.

**Outline.** The next process in determing one of many is having an idea of the position they would take in our relative space. This can pertain to facial features or body size. We would consider these descriptions to be shapes, which are inherently mathematic as well (see [geometry](https://mathsisfun.com/geometry/index.html)). Visually speaking, we really only see in 2 dimensions. Yet again, based on the feedback received through our eyes, we see contrast in colors which allow us to place points where we judge an object to be compared to it's surroundings, all of which eventually connect to create an outline or shape.

At this point, we recognize the exponential implausibility to progress through basic descriptive exercises without mere elementary arithmatic. Even grammatically speaking, the terminology I have been using is mathematical at it's core. Whether this was by design or not, our minds inherently understand the logical processes behind these terms and statistics. We create outlines of reality and provide output actions as a result of our brains processing information returned by sensory retrieval. There is no deviating from this loop. Our reality is mathematical by nature, so the question now has to be asked: how does math become the universal language?

According to Marriam-Webster, [language](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/language) involves "words, their pronunciation, and the methods of combining them used and understood by a community." Linguistics, more often than not, don't see mathematics and it's processes as mere transcriptions of what language can be but rather syntactical representations for pre-defined subject matters. The opposite is true, however. Written language, in and of itself, is also a syntactical representation. For a cohesive language to exist, the specific permutations and overall scaffolding of its contents require an associated interpretation. Otherwise, the complexities of spoken sounds and their written counterparts would be futile. Similarly, the application of well-known logical operators (+, -, x, ÷) within mathematics can only be coined productive if we tag them with a specific interpretation as well. For millenia, we have carefully crafted symbols, terminology, and their respective pronunciations to ensure that this virgin language would bloom to become fully realized and understood by the greater community. The development of arithmetic since the years B.C. have simply been an iteration of conventional, structured symbols used in combination to convey meanings. This allows us to get the same insights out of a calculation as we do from a conversation.

As a language, given these parameters, this study, so far, fits the mold. However, the thoery of omnipresence has not yet been confirmed. Luckily, this is resolved quite easily. Due to it's nature, calculation is fixed; it follows universal rules. There is right and there is wrong. Reality could not be constructed in any manner if a calculation was performed in any way against its design. This means that there are no dialects and, consequently, these concepts cannot be misinterpreted. 

Simply, an argument could be made that mathematics is just a field of study meant to explain our reality and, to a degree, I would have to admit that to be valid. However, through experimentation, calculation, and quantification of one natural process, additional processes continue to align with our findings. The following examples are just a few of the mathematical developments that have remained unchanged for hundreds, and even thousands, of years.

Number systems were created to allow for symbolic representation of quantity and, subsequently, calculation. Many date back to early civilizations in [Central Europe](https://fg.ed.pacificu.edu/charlesm/courses/mathsci/numsys/numsys.html). We constructed our base-10 system solely on the fact that we have ten fingers. Timekeeping began with a stick in the sand. Isaac Newton influenced the, let's be honest, **universally** accepted truth of [gravity](https://web.stanford.edu/~buzzt/gravity.html#:~:text=Sir%20Isaac%20Newton%20was%20an,about%20the%20forces%20of%20nature.) from an apple. The [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.livescience.com/37470-fibonacci-sequence.html) (a frequently apparent, mathematical phenomena in nature) was founded during a study of rabbit population. Concentric circles are seen in trees and ripples in the water and quantify the appearance of certain magnetic fields. Logic, a branch of mathematics, was developed by ancient [Greek philosophers](https://www.biography.com/scholar/aristotle) to help quantify and prove our reality. Sound familiar? These methodologies now serve as foundations for modern and contemporary principles ranging from the concepts of cancer research to artificial intelligence and even [space colonization](https://space.nss.org/stanford-torus-space-settlement/).

Deciphering abstractions of this nature is not a task stationed in everyone's skillset. This results in my claim being exceedingly undermined and gives reason to why I'm trying to garner more attention to it. It's beautiful to see the quantification and mathmatical representations of the world around us and how they play such an integral role in creating our reality. At this very moment, our reality continues to change. We are not timeless; it's a linear increase of infinitely small points in time that make up a steady stream of progression. It's our responsibility to flow with the continuity .
