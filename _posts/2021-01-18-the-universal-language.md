Consider a world without barriers. Conflict resolves with a single gesture. Hesitation and anxiety ease because there is no threat of miscommunication. Herein lies the concept of _the universal language_. The idea that the infeasiblility of global understanding is only a mirage created by the ambiguity of translation. Some believe this language (known as [Esperanto](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/13/413968033/esperanto-is-not-dead-can-the-universal-language-make-a-comeback)) has dated back over 100 years. Others see this dialect as [love](https://loverevolutionblog.com/kindness-the-universal-language-of-love/) or kindess. A more common theory simply states that there is [none at all](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ezpvx4/why-humans-dont-have-a-universal-language). However, I believe the solution to this debate has already been procured and has been evolving since the dawn of time. Unfortunately, it's just not as recognizable as we would think.

Whether we believe the universe to have formed 13,800,000,000 years ago or in 7 days by God, we find ourselves on this "Pale Blue Dot" with a conscious seeking to determine our greater purpose. Specialists from various subject matters and diverging backgrounds parley in attempts to evaluate our reality; to discover what it is to be human. Spectacularly, we still don't have any conclusive results. Perhaps a culmination of this, seemingly circular, research is either inattainable or would be better left undefined. After all, it's entirely possible that our human errors could, in fact, subtract from what we _do_ know. So...what do we know then?

Putting 100,000,000,000 neurons to good use, I can tell you that, at 9:47p.m., I remain an average distance of about 93,000,000 miles from the sun. I know that out of 7,500,000,000 people in the world, I am one of many who has 5 fingers on each hand and 5 toes on each foot. 

timeless has become a time stamp.
