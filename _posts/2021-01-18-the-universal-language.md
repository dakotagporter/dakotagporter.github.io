Consider a world without barriers. Conflict resolves with a single gesture. Hesitation and anxiety ease because there is no threat of miscommunication. Herein lies the concept of _the universal language_. The idea that the infeasiblility of global understanding is only a mirage created by the ambiguity of translation. Some believe this language (known as [Esperanto](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/13/413968033/esperanto-is-not-dead-can-the-universal-language-make-a-comeback)) has dated back over 100 years. Others see this dialect as [love](https://loverevolutionblog.com/kindness-the-universal-language-of-love/) or kindess. A more common theory simply states that there is just [no such thing](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ezpvx4/why-humans-dont-have-a-universal-language). However, I believe the solution to this debate has already been procured and has been evolving since the dawn of time. Unfortunately, it's just not as recognizable as we would think.

Whether we believe the universe to have formed 13,800,000,000 years ago or in 7 days by God, we find ourselves on this [Pale Blue Dot](https://www.planetary.org/worlds/pale-blue-dot) with a conscious seeking to determine our greater purpose. Specialists from various subject matters and diverging backgrounds parley in attempts to evaluate our reality; to discover what it is to be human. Spectacularly, we still don't have any conclusive results. After all, by it's own definition reality is only existant based off of what is both known and unknown. Perhaps a culmination of this, seemingly circular, research is either inattainable or would be better left undefined. A metaphorical asymptote has developed in its place: we can get infinitely close but, in the end, never converge to a resolution. Besides, it's entirely possible that our human errors could, in fact, subtract from what we _do_ know. So...what do we know then?

Putting 100,000,000,000 neurons to good use, I can tell you that, at 9:47p.m., I remain an average distance of about 93,000,000 miles from the sun. I know that out of 7,500,000,000 people in the world, I am one of many who has lived through 365 days of the year 2020. These facts specify what it is to be me but can actually characterize many others given the vague approach to the measurements I have chosen. In order to abstract myself further from the general population, I must define particular metrics that will allow for the evaluation of relativity between myself and the people around me. I weigh 160 pounds and stand about 5 feet 10 inches. I have 16 tattoos on my left arm and 77,652 miles on my car. Whoever _I_ am, now differs from what we know to be everyone else. I now challenge you to answer this question devoid of numeric representation. Give me an idea (as specfic as possible) of who you are apart from the residual public without any form of quantification. Free of visual depiction, it's nearly impossible to construct a personal rendition of an object planted in my reality. Any true results of a task like this would only produce the most vague of understandings.

The universe and what we know to exist within it was, and is, meant to be quantified. A little thing known as **time** uses the combination of integers and other symbols to produce a convenient tracking system for our progress on this Earth. Logic, a branch of mathematics, allowed Aristotle to shape [philosophy](https://www.biography.com/scholar/aristotle) as we know it. Linguistics, more often than not, don't see mathematical quantification as a mere transcription of what a language can be but rather a syntactical representation for pre-defined subject matter. The opposite is true, however. According to Marriam-Webster, [language](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/language) involves "words, their pronunciation, and the methods of combining them used and understood by a community." The development of arithmetic since the years B.C. have similarly been an iteration of conventional, structured symbols used in combination to convey meanings and this practice was no doubt widely understood as well. For a cohesive language to exist, the specific permutations and overall scaffolding require an interpretation to be associated to it. Otherwise, the mess of spoken sounds and their written counterparts would be futile. The application of well-known logical operators (+, -, x, รท) can only be coined productive if we tag them with a similar interpretation. We constructed a number system based on the amount of fingers we have. An argument could be made that mathematics is just a field of study meant to explain our reality and, to a degree, I would have to admit that to be valid. However, through experimentation and calculation of one natural process, additional processes continue to align with our findings.

Are the well known logical operators  not conventional symbols

Deciphering these concepts is not a task stationed in everyone's skillset. This results in my claim being vastly undermined and gives reason to why I'm trying to garner more attention to it. 


The theory of timelessness has now become a time stamp.

reality defined by math: relativity/comparisons, time, foundations/familiarity
